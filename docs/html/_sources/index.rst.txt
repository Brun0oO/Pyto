Welcome to Pyto's documentation!
================================

Pyto is an open source app to code and run Python code locally on an iPad or iPhone.
The app uses the Python C API to run Python code in the same process of the app, due to iOS restrictions. Third party pure Python modules can be installed from PyPi and some modules are bundled in the app, like ``Numpy``, ``Matplotlib``, ``Pandas``, ``Pillow`` or ``Biopython``.
