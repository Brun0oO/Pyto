           A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
           ==========================

           Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
           Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
           as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
           principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

           In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
           National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
           in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
           software.

           In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
           BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
           year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
           Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
           https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
           created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
           Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

           All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
           the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
           releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
           the various releases.

           Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
           from                                compatible? (1)

           0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
           1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
           1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
           2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
           1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
           2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
           2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
           2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
           2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
           2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
           2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

           Footnotes:

           (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
           the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
           a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
           GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
           other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

           (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
           because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
           CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
           is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

           Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
           direction to make these releases possible.

           OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

           6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material

           Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
           Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
           License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of

           A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
           ==========================

           Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
           Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
           as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
           principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

           In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
           National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
           in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
           software.

           In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
           BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
           year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
           Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
           Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
           non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
           Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
           the PSF.

           All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
           the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
           releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
           the various releases.

           Footnotes:

           (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
           the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
           a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
           GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
           other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

           (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
           because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
           CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
           is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

           Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
           direction to make these releases possible.

           4. CNRI is making Python 1.6.1 available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
           basis.  CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
           IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND

           INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

           5. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
           1.6.1 FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
           A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 1.6.1,
           OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

           6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material

           limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
           U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
           Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
           on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
           previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
           law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
           Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
           Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
           License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
           agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
           License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or
           trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
           services of Licensee, or any third party.

           8. By clicking on the "ACCEPT" button where indicated, or by copying,
           installing or otherwise using Python 1.6.1, Licensee agrees to be

           About Kiwi
           ----------
           Chris Colbert began the Kiwi project in December 2013 in an effort to
           create a blisteringly fast UI constraint solver. Chris is still the
           project lead.

           The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic
           project and its subprojects.

           The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
           http://github.com/nucleic. The current team consists of:

           * Chris Colbert

           Our Copyright Policy
           --------------------
           Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
           over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
           contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
           source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
           institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
           Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
           changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
           their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
           change to one of the Nucleic repositories.

           With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
           to indicate the copyright and license terms:

           #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           # Copyright (c) 2013, Nucleic Development Team.

           This packge contains a modified version of ca-bundle.crt:

           ca-bundle.crt -- Bundle of CA Root Certificates

           Certificate data from Mozilla as of: Thu Nov  3 19:04:19 2011#
           This is a bundle of X.509 certificates of public Certificate Authorities
           (CA). These were automatically extracted from Mozilla's root certificates
           file (certdata.txt).  This file can be found in the mozilla source tree:
           http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1#
           It contains the certificates in PEM format and therefore
           can be directly used with curl / libcurl / php_curl, or with
           an Apache+mod_ssl webserver for SSL client authentication.
           Just configure this file as the SSLCACertificateFile.#
